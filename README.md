# Pill dispenser

Implementation of an automated pill dispenser using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller (RP2040). The system involves hardware components such as a stepper motor (28BYJ-48), a piezoelectric sensor, an opto fork, an EEPROM module (AT24C256) and a LoRa-E5 Wireless module. The dispenser is designed to dispense daily medication to a patient, and the program handles the dispenser's operation, calibration, and communication with an external server.
